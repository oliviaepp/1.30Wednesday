## Project 1: Responsive Website
### Reflection
When approaching creating this website I aimed to design a simple website with the key information the Contour website did not have. This included more artwork on each page, maps and simple, clear text. To achieve this, I designed some low-fi prototypes (see below). These designs feature more images and less text on each web page. The main challenge I faced when creating my responsive website was being able to format the website the way I designed it in my low-fi prototype. The things that were included from my prototype were the even margin that the text sits in as well as the general idea of a layout for the web page. This worked well for me when creating the website as everything is evenly spaced throughout the website. I used a grid template area to set the margins used throughout. I found this process a difficult concept to understand at first but after understanding the role of wrappers more clearly, I knew how to layout a website in a consistent way. Another thing I struggled with was the image grid on the art page. I wanted to format the images with text underneath but I could not find a way to add text into this grid. I tried adding transparent text boxes onto the picture but that changed the layout of the images. I struggled to understand how I could solve the problem so I decided to leave the text out and just have images from the 2020 festival. I had to enter the code twice because the first time each row was different heights. This was because I adjusted the css settings while trying to add text so redoing the image grid was the easiest solution to this problem. To improve my website, I could’ve added text to the art page grid and centre align the list of supporters on the donate page. I didn’t centre align this list because it changed the position of the list in the header. I also deleted the contact page as I could not find any content to put on the page. The map does that job as when the new locations will be released, they will pop up. I also added the Instagram handle on the about us page. I think the key thing I did well was the spacing between headers and paragraphs throughout the page. The gaps give enough room for the text to breathe on each page. I also think I structured my code well in my documents. As the project went on, I found myself being more confident in how I could solve some smaller formatting problems such as what classes different text elements and images belong in. I purposefully chose for the titles to have lowercase characters because that is the style guide the canberra art biennial follows.

### Resources
Dcode, 2021, How to create an image gallery – HTML, CSS Web Design Tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnhoY5Cdmy0&t=634s 
This was the main external resource I used throughout my project. It helped me create the image grid on the art page and was an interesting video. It showed me a way that I wouldn’t have considered creating an image grid.

W3Schools, 2022, Learn to Code, https://www.w3schools.com/ I also used w3schools for several different elements of the code. I found this resource slightly difficult to use as it was hard to find what I was looking for at times.
